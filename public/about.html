<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Viet Nguyen and I recently graduated at the University of Maryland
  majoring in Information Science with a passion for front-end development,
  design, and and I also find satisfaction in working with data, especially
  using SQL to solve complex problems and uncover insights. My journey into tech
  has been shaped by hands-on projects, hackathons, and online courses where
  I’ve developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and database design.

  Recently, I had the opportunity to work with a real-world client through my
  capstone course, INST490. As part of a team of four, we delivered a complete
  database schema and design tailored to the client’s needs. This experience
  deepened my interest in both data architecture and web development, and it
  reinforced my passion for building effective, real-world solutions. I’m
  excited to continue growing and showcasing my skills, and I’m eager to
  contribute to companies that value innovation and thoughtful design.
